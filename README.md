Heads-Up No Limit Hold 'Em

TODO
- Finish showdown
- At some point, it might be nice if HandScore included the cards which made up the hand instead of just the kickers which don't?
  - useful for gui stuff, showing the cards the player won with
  - this creates a more important distunction between kickers and leftovers i'd rather not deal with right now
